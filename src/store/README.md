[Redux-zero](https://github.com/redux-zero/redux-zero) is used to provide global state. See it's README for more information but in a nutshell:

- Based on Redux
- Zero dependencies (and < 1KB when gzipped)
- Zero dispatch's or reducers to write :-)
- Much less boiler plate overall, making for much easier to read/maintain code
- Still works with Redux dev tools (lovely jubbly)
